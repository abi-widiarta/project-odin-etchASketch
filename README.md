# The Odin Project | Etch a Sketch

What I Learn :
- Found a really cool draggable rotation knob on gsap
- eventListener
- disabling draggable div in the board, by using ondragstart,ondragend event listener end preventDefault

Notes for this project :
- Not responsive yet
- The UI can still be improved
- Planning to add a erase button
- Planning to make the result downloadable as image by using html2canvas library
- UI design inspired from https://github.com/Silinde87/top-etch-a-sketch
